Team Arcade presents: 
JumPin

JumPin is a Foddian-style 2D platformer where the player controls a ball, from the classic arcade cabinet pinball games. Travel through levels of pinball craziness to return to your own pinball machine, and be careful not to slip!

JumPin builds on the traditional Foddian style by emphasizing the spherical form of the player. The player character will react with all slopes throughout the game, thus making every jump a very precise maneuver, and making falls much more punishing, as a little horizontal speed can take you a long way down.
